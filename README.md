# Bank_Loan_Status_Report
This project analysed banking data to understand customer loan statuses and profiles, aiding in risk assessment and decision-making.

This project involved analyzing banking data to gain insights into customer loan statuses and profiles. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of loan statuses, average loan amounts, loan term variations, credit score distributions, and homeownership distributions among customers.

In Excel, I cleaned and organized the raw data to prepare it for analysis. I used SQL queries to extract and manipulate data, such as calculating average loan amounts and determining the distribution of home ownership statuses.

Using Power BI, I created interactive visualizations to present key findings, such as the distribution of loan statuses and the average credit score for customers with different loan statuses. These visualizations helped in understanding the loan portfolio's health, customer demographics, and risk assessment.
